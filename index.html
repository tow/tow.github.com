I wanted to call this blog "I'm right and you're wrong", but Nigeria wouldn't let me, so I settled for an obscure Unix joke funny to nobody but me (Israel wouldn't play ball either).


I'm Toby White, and I help run <a href="http://inkling-software.co.uk">Inkling Software</a>. But the opinions expressed here are mine &mdash don't blame Inkling for them.
