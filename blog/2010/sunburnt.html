<!-- Hyde::Article::Begin -->

<p>I <a href="http://blog.timetric.com/2010/02/sunburnt-a-python-solr-interface/">recently had cause</a> to spend lots of time playing around with talking
to <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Solr</a> from Python, and ended up
writing my own interface code,
<a href="http://github.com/tow/sunburnt/">Sunburnt</a>. Of course, there are several python/solr libraries already available &mdash;
even a brief survey&nbsp;shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/pysolr/">pysolr</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="http://bitbucket.org/cogtree/python-solr/overview/">python-solr</a> (which is a slightly enhanced version of&nbsp;pysolr)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/solrpy/">solrpy</a>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and on a separate&nbsp;level,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<a href="http://haystacksearch.org/">haystack</a> which seems to be becoming the
  standard Django solution for search backends. (It supports other
  backends as well as solr, but when using solr it relies on pysolr for communication with the search&nbsp;engine)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s reasonable to ask why I didn&#8217;t just use one of them.
The role of the interface I wanted was&nbsp;basically</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>
to present solr updates/queries in a Pythonic fashion. I shouldn&#8217;t
have to read the Solr docs to use most of the <span class="caps">API</span>. Where I need to
understand the <span class="caps">API</span> to make use of it, I should be able to do so
Pythonically, rather than mucking about with Solr/Lucene syntax,
string construction, and multiple layers of special-character&nbsp;escaping.
</p>
<p>(and for &#8220;I&#8221;, read &#8220;anyone else touching the code, including me several months from&nbsp;now&#8221;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
to stop me (or whoever else touches this code) from making stupid
mistakes. If I try to do something stupid, it should shout and tell me
what I did&nbsp;wrong.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>None of the existing libraries really fulfil these&nbsp;criteria.</p>
<h3><a name="_python_only_libraries"></a>Python-only&nbsp;libraries</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
pysolr/python-solr
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>pysolr and python-solr are fairly low-level. One of the very nice things
about Solr is that its <span class="caps">API</span> can be entirely driven over <span class="caps">HTTP</span>; if you know the
Solr <span class="caps">API</span> fairly well, it&#8217;s quite easy to index and query a Solr instance
from curl or, for that matter, through <a href="http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/">httplib2</a>.</p>
<p>For many lightweight uses, that would be a perfectly sensible
approach &mdash; I suspect it&#8217;s one a number of people use, though it
requires you to learn the Solr <span class="caps">API</span>, and Lucene query&nbsp;syntax.</p>
<p>However, most of what pysolr/python-solr do is simply to abstract over
that <span class="caps">HTTP</span> layer (which is the easy bit, especially for anyone else
reading your code) while not really helping you
with the Solr/Lucene <span class="caps">API</span> (which is not). They don&#8217;t offer you
much help in extracting your results from Solr&#8217;s responses, and nor
do they know how to deal correctly with datetime&nbsp;objects.</p>
<table frame="void" cellpadding="8">
<tr valign="top"><td><p><b><u>Note</u></b></p></td>
<td style="border-left: 1px solid silver;">I was also slightly alarmed by the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pysolr/source/browse/trunk/pysolr.py#297"><tt>eval()</tt> of raw data coming from Solr</a></td></tr></table>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
solrpy
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>solrpy is provided by the Solr project itself, and seems to be fairly
well written. It manages to abstract away most of the Lucene query
syntax, but still requires a reasonable familiarity with the Solr <span class="caps">API</span>,
though, especially for any queries beyond the very&nbsp;basic.</p>
<table frame="void" cellpadding="8">
<tr valign="top"><td><p><b><u>Note</u></b></p></td>
<td style="border-left: 1px solid silver;">
<p><b>Datatype&nbsp;checking/coercion</b></p>
<p>None of these support any form of datatype checking; that is, if I try
to push a document with numeric fields where text fields are expected,
they&#8217;ll carry on regardless and choke on the resulting Solr
error. Similarly, if I specify, for example, a numerical range search
on a textual&nbsp;field.</p>
</td></tr></table>
<h3><a name="_django_libraries"></a>Django&nbsp;libraries</h3>
<p>Or library (singular), in&nbsp;fact.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
haystack
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One of Haystack&#8217;s biggest advantages is that it&#8217;s closely tied to the Django world. If you&#8217;re writing a Django project, and you need search functionality, Haystack probably should be your first port of&nbsp;call.</p>
<p>It has a very nice interface for marking up your Django models indicating which fields should be searchable, and how; it has an <span class="caps">API</span> that will be very familiar to anyone who&#8217;s used the Django <span class="caps">ORM</span>&nbsp;<span class="caps">API</span>.</p>
<p>However, as a result, it&#8217;s very strongly tied to Django&#8217;s models as
the data store. Indeed, the <a href="http://haystacksearch.org/docs/faq.html#when-should-i-not-be-using-haystack">Haystack <span class="caps">FAQ</span> itself says</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When should I not be using&nbsp;Haystack?</p>
<p>Non-Model-based data. If you just want to index random data (flat files, alternate sources, etc.), Haystack isn&#8217;t a good solution. Haystack is very Model-based and doesn&#8217;t work well outside of that use&nbsp;case.</p>
<p align="right">
&#8212; Haystack&nbsp;<span class="caps">FAQ</span>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So for any non-Django projects &mdash; or even for any Django projects which
need to worry about data stored outside the <span class="caps">ORM</span> (which is true of
Timetric -
<a href="http://blog.timetric.com/2009/05/upgrading-the-timetric-backend/">all
the timeseries data is stored on Tokyo Tyrant</a>), Haystack is a bit of
a&nbsp;non-starter.</p>
<p>For that matter, if you&#8217;re starting a new Python project to talk to an
existing Solr instance, then it might be too much overhead to place the
whole thing within a Django framework, and come up with placeholder
Django db&nbsp;models.</p>
<h3><a name="_schema_driven_versus_schema_generating"></a>Schema-driven versus&nbsp;schema-generating</h3>
<p>Much like <span class="caps">RDBMS</span> systems, search engines need a schema. Search engines
work on &#8220;documents&#8221;, which are collections of fields, and the search
engine needs to know what to do with these fields &mdash; how to index them,
how to preprocess/tokenize before indexing, perhaps how to construct
searchable derived&nbsp;fields.</p>
<p>Part of the role of a search engine interface is to map between the
entities the search engine knows about (documents) and the entities
the programming language knows about (Python/Django objects, in this
case). This is much like the mapping that an <span class="caps">ORM</span>&nbsp;maintains.</p>
<p>In the case of Solr, you need to know that sometimes when Solr returns
you the string &#8220;2009-01-01&#8221; it&#8217;s simply a string, but sometimes it&#8217;s a
date. The only way to tell is to be aware of the&nbsp;schema.</p>
<p>In generating this mapping for an <span class="caps">RDBMS</span> there are effectively two&nbsp;approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
they can be schema-generating (like Django&#8217;s <span class="caps">ORM</span>). That is, you need
  never care about the details of the underlying schema, you just
  provide templates for objects, and the mapping is done for&nbsp;you.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
they can be schema-driven (like
  <a href="https://storm.canonical.com">Storm</a>). That is, the database schema is
  constructed ab initio, and then somehow a mapping is provided  from
  the tables defined in the schema to objects in the <span class="caps">OO</span>&nbsp;language.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Django (until recently) has entirely been schema-generating (see the
<a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.1/howto/legacy-databases/#auto-generate-the-models">inspectdb</a>
command for how to work otherwise), and Haystack adopts this approach
too. It&#8217;s perfectly reasonable for many use-cases, and is one less
thing for an application author to think&nbsp;about.</p>
<p>However, if you want to generate the schema yourself for any reason,
then it&#8217;s difficult to retrofit an existing schema into a
schema-generating <span class="caps">ORM</span>. There&#8217;s a (biased) overview from the author of
Storm <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/jamesh/2007/09/28/orm-schema-generation/">in one of his blog posts</a>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, search engine schemata are a great deal simpler than
<span class="caps">RDBMS</span> schemata, at least where object mapping is concerned. There&#8217;s no
joins (inter-object-linkage) to worry about; only a mapping from
documents to objects which are little more than dictionaries of typed
attributes. This means that it&#8217;s easy, given a hand-crafted schema, to
generate the resulting mapping, and apply proper type-checking
throughout the&nbsp;interface.</p>
<p>None of the libraries above, however, have any features in this
direction. Only Haystack pays any attention to the schema at all, and
it is explicitly schema-generating (though it lets you make a wide
variety of tweaks to the schema while generating&nbsp;it.</p>
<h3><a name="_sunburnt"></a>Sunburnt</h3>
<p>So the missing parts of my initial criteria boil down&nbsp;to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>
lack of a high-level <span class="caps">API</span> for arbitrary Python&nbsp;objects
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
lack of a meaningful object/schema&nbsp;mapper.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Fixing those issues is <a href="http://github.com/tow/sunburnt/">Sunburnt</a>&#8216;s
<em>raison d&#8217;être</em> &mdash; it provides both. The code is <a href="http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/">freely reusable</a>,
so if anyone else finds this sort of <span class="caps">API</span> useful, then dive&nbsp;in.</p>
