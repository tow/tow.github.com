I http://blog.timetric.com/2010/02/sunburnt-a-python-solr-interface/[recently had cause] to spend lots of time playing around with talking
to http://lucene.apache.org/solr/[Solr] from Python, and ended up
writing my own interface code,
http://github.com/tow/sunburnt/[Sunburnt]. Of course, there are several python/solr libraries already available &mdash;
even a brief survey shows:

* http://code.google.com/p/pysolr/[pysolr]
* http://bitbucket.org/cogtree/python-solr/overview/[python-solr] (which is a slightly enhanced version of pysolr)
* http://pypi.python.org/pypi/solrpy/[solrpy]

and on a separate level,

* http://haystacksearch.org/[haystack] which seems to be becoming the
  standard Django solution for search backends. (It supports other
  backends as well as solr, but when using solr it relies on pysolr for communication with the search engine)

It's reasonable to ask why I didn't just use one of them.
The role of the interface I wanted was basically

1. to present solr updates/queries in a Pythonic fashion. I shouldn't
have to read the Solr docs to use most of the API. Where I need to
understand the API to make use of it, I should be able to do so
Pythonically, rather than mucking about with Solr/Lucene syntax,
string construction, and multiple layers of special-character escaping.
+
(and for "I", read "anyone else touching the code, including me several months from now")

2. to stop me (or whoever else touches this code) from making stupid
mistakes. If I try to do something stupid, it should shout and tell me
what I did wrong.

None of the existing libraries really fulfil these criteria.

Python-only libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* pysolr/python-solr

pysolr and python-solr are fairly low-level. One of the very nice things
about Solr is that its API can be entirely driven over HTTP; if you know the
Solr API fairly well, it's quite easy to index and query a Solr instance
from curl or, for that matter, through http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/[httplib2].

For many lightweight uses, that would be a perfectly sensible
approach &mdash; I suspect it's one a number of people use, though it
requires you to learn the Solr API, and Lucene query syntax.

However, most of what pysolr/python-solr do is simply to abstract over
that HTTP layer (which is the easy bit, especially for anyone else
reading your code) while not really helping you
with the Solr/Lucene API (which is not). They don't offer you
much help in extracting your results from Solr's responses, and nor
do they know how to deal correctly with datetime objects.

NOTE: I was also slightly alarmed by the http://code.google.com/p/pysolr/source/browse/trunk/pysolr.py#297[`eval()` of raw data coming from Solr]

* solrpy

solrpy is provided by the Solr project itself, and seems to be fairly
well written. It manages to abstract away most of the Lucene query
syntax, but still requires a reasonable familiarity with the Solr API,
though, especially for any queries beyond the very basic.

[NOTE]
.Datatype checking/coercion
============================================
None of these support any form of datatype checking; that is, if I try
to push a document with numeric fields where text fields are expected,
they'll carry on regardless and choke on the resulting Solr
error. Similarly, if I specify, for example, a numerical range search
on a textual field.
===========================================

Django libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Or library (singular), in fact.

* haystack

One of Haystack's biggest advantages is that it's closely tied to the Django world. If you're writing a Django project, and you need search functionality, Haystack probably should be your first port of call.

It has a very nice interface for marking up your Django models indicating which fields should be searchable, and how; it has an API that will be very familiar to anyone who's used the Django ORM API.

However, as a result, it's very strongly tied to Django's models as
the data store. Indeed, the http://haystacksearch.org/docs/faq.html#when-should-i-not-be-using-haystack[Haystack FAQ itself says]:

[quote, Haystack FAQ]
____________________________________________________________________
When should I not be using Haystack?

Non-Model-based data. If you just want to index random data (flat files, alternate sources, etc.), Haystack isn't a good solution. Haystack is very Model-based and doesn't work well outside of that use case.
____________________________________________________________________

So for any non-Django projects &mdash; or even for any Django projects which
need to worry about data stored outside the ORM (which is true of
Timetric -
http://blog.timetric.com/2009/05/upgrading-the-timetric-backend/[all
the timeseries data is stored on Tokyo Tyrant]), Haystack is a bit of
a non-starter.

For that matter, if you're starting a new Python project to talk to an
existing Solr instance, then it might be too much overhead to place the
whole thing within a Django framework, and come up with placeholder
Django db models.


Schema-driven versus schema-generating
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Much like RDBMS systems, search engines need a schema. Search engines
work on "documents", which are collections of fields, and the search
engine needs to know what to do with these fields &mdash; how to index them,
how to preprocess/tokenize before indexing, perhaps how to construct
searchable derived fields.
 
Part of the role of a search engine interface is to map between the
entities the search engine knows about (documents) and the entities
the programming language knows about (Python/Django objects, in this
case). This is much like the mapping that an ORM maintains.

In the case of Solr, you need to know that sometimes when Solr returns
you the string "2009-01-01" it's simply a string, but sometimes it's a
date. The only way to tell is to be aware of the schema.

In generating this mapping for an RDBMS there are effectively two approaches:

* they can be schema-generating (like Django's ORM). That is, you need
  never care about the details of the underlying schema, you just
  provide templates for objects, and the mapping is done for you.

* they can be schema-driven (like
  https://storm.canonical.com[Storm]). That is, the database schema is
  constructed ab initio, and then somehow a mapping is provided  from
  the tables defined in the schema to objects in the OO language.

Django (until recently) has entirely been schema-generating (see the
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.1/howto/legacy-databases/#auto-generate-the-models[inspectdb]
command for how to work otherwise), and Haystack adopts this approach
too. It's perfectly reasonable for many use-cases, and is one less
thing for an application author to think about.

However, if you want to generate the schema yourself for any reason,
then it's difficult to retrofit an existing schema into a
schema-generating ORM. There's a (biased) overview from the author of
Storm http://blogs.gnome.org/jamesh/2007/09/28/orm-schema-generation/[in one of his blog posts].

Fortunately, search engine schemata are a great deal simpler than
RDBMS schemata, at least where object mapping is concerned. There's no
joins (inter-object-linkage) to worry about; only a mapping from
documents to objects which are little more than dictionaries of typed
attributes. This means that it's easy, given a hand-crafted schema, to
generate the resulting mapping, and apply proper type-checking
throughout the interface. 

None of the libraries above, however, have any features in this
direction. Only Haystack pays any attention to the schema at all, and
it is explicitly schema-generating (though it lets you make a wide
variety of tweaks to the schema while generating it.

~~~~~~~~

So the missing parts of my initial criteria boil down to:

1. lack of a high-level API for arbitrary Python objects
2. lack of a meaningful object/schema mapper. 

Fixing those issues is http://github.com/tow/sunburnt/[Sunburnt]'s
_raison d'Ãªtre_ &mdash; it provides both. The code is http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/[freely reusable],
so if anyone else finds this sort of API useful, then dive in.
